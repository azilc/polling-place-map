    <h3>About this tool</h3>
    <p class="small">
      This is not a voter registration tool. It is to help people find out where and when they are able to vote. The data is provided by the ASU Law Indian Legal Clinic and is kept as up-to-date as possible. If in doubt, call your county elections office. If you want to check your voter registration or register to vote, go to the AZ Secretary of State's site <a href="https://my.arizona.vote/WhereToVote.aspx?s=individual">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      This tool collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
      web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
      type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
      visitor request. The purpose of collecting non-personally identifying
      information is to better understand how visitors use the tool. From time
      to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the
      aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
      website.
